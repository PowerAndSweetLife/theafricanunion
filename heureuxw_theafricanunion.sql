The Kalahari Desert and the Okavango Delta cover the majority of its territory, and provide animals with lush vegetation during seasonal floods. The huge Central Kalahari Game Reserve, with its dry fossil valleys and rolling grasslands, is home to many species including giraffes, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs. Safaris are a popular activity in Botswana .', 'botswana', 'A country of slightly over 2.3 million people,[16] Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. It is essentially the nation state of the Tswana, who make up 79% of the population.[17] About 11.6 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, Gaborone. Formerly one of the world\'s poorest countries—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—it has since transformed itself into an upper-middle-income country, with one of the world\'s fastest-growing economies.[18]\r\n\r\nModern-day humans first inhabited the country over 200,000 years ago. The Tswana ethnic group were descended mainly from Bantu-speaking tribes who migrated southward of Africa to modern Botswana around 600 AD, living in tribal enclaves as farmers and herders. In 1885, the British colonised the area and declared a protectorate under the name of Bechuanaland. As decolonisation occurred, Bechuanaland became an independent Commonwealth republic under its current name on 30 September 1966.[19] Since then, it has been a representative republic, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections and the lowest perceived corruption ranking in Africa since at least 1998 .', 'The economy of Botswana is currently one of the world\'s fastest growing economies,[18] averaging about 5% per annum over the past decade.[18] Growth in private sector employment averaged about 10% per annum during the first 30 years of the country\'s independence. After a period of stagnation at the turn of the 21st century, Botswana\'s economy registered strong levels of growth, with GDP growth exceeding 6-7% targets. Botswana has been praised by the African Development Bank for sustaining one of the world\'s longest economic booms.Economic growth since the late 1960s has been on par with some of Asia\'s largest economies. The government has consistently maintained budget surpluses and has extensive foreign-exchange reserves.\r\n\r\nBotswana\'s impressive economic record compared to some of its neighbors has been built on a foundation of diamond mining, prudent fiscal policies, and a cautious foreign policy.Botswana\'s economy is mostly dependent on diamond mining. Diamond mining contributes to 50% of the government revenue mainly through its 50:50 joint venture with De Beers in the Debswana Diamond Company. It is rated as the least corrupt country in Africa in the Corruption Perceptions Index by international corruption watchdog Transparency International. It has the fourth highest gross national income per capita in purchasing power in Africa and above the world average .', 'Politics in Botswana is framed by a presidential system of republican representative democracy, in which the President of Botswana is both head of state and government, within a multi-party system. Executive power is vested in the government. Legislative power evolves in the government and parliament of Botswana. Since the country\'s independence, the party system has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\r\n\r\nBotswana is a multi-party constitutional democracy. Every election since independence in September 1966 has been free and timely. The white minority as well as other minorities in the country participate freely in the democratic process. There are two main parties as well as several minor parties. However, Botswana is also a state dominated by a major party, the BDP which has never lost power since independence. It is claimed that the country\'s openness and political system have been the determining factors in Botswana\'s stability and economic growth. General elections are held every 5 years.', 'At the end of the 19th century, hostilities broke out between the Tswanas, living in Botswana, and the Ndebele tribes migrating to this territory from the Kalahari Desert. Tensions also rise a notch with the Boer settlers coming from the Transvaal. After requests for assistance made by the Botswana rulers Khama III, Bathoen and Sebele, the British government placed Bechuanaland under its protection on March 31, 1885. The northern part of this territory came under direct administration as a protectorate of Bechuanaland, forming present-day Botswana. The southern part of the territory is integrated into the Cape Colony, and is now part of the North West Province of South Africa. The majority of Setswana-speaking people today live in South Africa.\r\n\r\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, encompassing the main British colonies in the region, the protectorate of Bechuanaland, Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Swaziland (now Eswatini) - the High Commission Territories - were not not included, but future incorporation is planned. However, the British Empire vaguely undertakes to consult the inhabitants of these territories beforehand. Although successive governments of South Africa have repeatedly sought to integrate these territories, the United Kingdom continues to delay its decision, and this integration never took place. In 1948, the National Party was elected to government and established apartheid in South Africa. He withdrew from the Commonwealth community in 1961, thus ending any prospect of integrating these territories into South Africa.', 'uploads/lova002.png', 'Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana - whether construed as members of the Setswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.[citation needed] the Batswana believe in the rich culture of Botho-Ubuntu, ‘‘People are not individuals, living in a state of independence, but part of a community, living in relationships and interdependence.’[1] Batswana believe in working together and in being united.\r\n\r\nThe name Batswana is used as a nationality for the people of Botswana and as an ethnicity for people who practice the same culture and speak the same language in neighbouring South Africa.There are different ethnic groups in the country Botswana among them are the Tswana (Barolong, Bakwena, Bangwato, Batlokwa, Bakgatla, Baphuthing, Bataung, Bangwaketse, Batawana, Bahurutshe, Balete); BaKalanga (BaLilima, Baperi, BaWumbe, BaNambya); Ovaherero (Baherero, Ovambanderu); Wayei, Bambukushu; Veekuhane (Basubiya in Setswana); Khoe & San groups; Batswapong and Batshweneng.[2] All these tribes believe in different customs however because of living together & inter-marrying for more than a century, they have now developed some similarities which are seen in the changing or developing languages in the country as well as shared cultures . The languages differ significantly from one area to the other or by the ethnic dialects but they are all regarded as Botswana languages. Some Tswana people are based in the Northwest Province of the Republic of South Africa, and Botswana.', 'uploads/download (32).jpg'),

Official languages are French and English for a country with a multitude of local languages.', 'camerron', 'Before the colonial period, the inhabitants did not form a single homogeneous group and presented several forms of social organization ranging from structured kingdoms to nomadic ethnic groups. The former kingdoms (Bamoun, Bonjongo, Adamaoua, Garoua) were followed in the 19th century by German colonization, which placed Cameroon under a protectorate. At the end of the First World War, Cameroon was placed under a mandate from the League of Nations and entrusted to the administration of France for its eastern part and of the United Kingdom for its western part. In the aftermath of the Second World War, it was placed under the supervision of the UN, which reallocated its administration to the two countries. The former trusteeship of the UN under French administration gained independence under the name of Republic of Cameroon on January 1, 1960 with President Ahmadou Ahidjo.

The Portuguese will divert to their advantage the trade in spices, gold, ivory and slaves. This will deal a severe blow to Arab trade and accelerate the decadence of the Muslim states of the Mediterranean. The Portuguese no longer want to depend on the Arabs to supply themselves with exotic products.\r\n\r\nFrom 1500, they undertook the conquest of all the Arab trading posts on the African coast of the Indian Ocean. Catches that will be made by force.', 'uploads/lova34.jpg', 'The culture of Mauritius, a small island country in southern Africa, first refers to the observable cultural practices of its 1,500,000 inhabitants. Mauritian culture is characterized by an astonishing diversity of imaginations, languages ​​and texts. This one is very influenced by Caribbean culture.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Museum of Natural History of Port-Louis.\r\nIndeed, on this island, originally deserted, discovered by the Arabs, visited by the Portuguese and the Dutch, with a lasting phase of French and English colonization, Africans, taken as slaves, rubbed shoulders with coolies or Indians and Chinese, especially traders. A population of mestizos or mulattos developed there, mainly from blacks, also called creoles, and whites, from France.<br><br>These numerous migrations, marked by slavery and indenture, created conflicts and violence that marked the collective unconscious of this small democratic country, which became independent in 1968. However, there remains a potential for encounters, and a miracle of coexistence between Hindus from North and South India, Christians, Muslims , Taoists and Buddhists that deeply mark the visitor.', 'uploads/download (76).jpg'),

The largest island, São Tomé, is home to the lagoon of Lagoa Azul. The Ôbo Natural Park, a jungle protected for its biodiversity, covers most of the territory of São Tomé and is distinguished by the Pico Cão Grande, a volcanic rock similar to a skyscraper.', 'sao-tome', 'Sao Tomé and Principe, São Tomé and Príncipe or Saint Thomas and Prince\'s Island, in long form the Democratic Republic of Sao Tomé and Principe (in Portuguese: São Tomé e Príncipe, A Ilha of São Tomé and Príncipe and República Democrática de São Tomé and Príncipe), is an island state in Central Africa, one of the smallest countries in Africa. It occupies an archipelago in the central South Atlantic located in the Gulf of Guinea, 239 km from the coast of Gabon (São Tomé) and 216 km from Equatorial Guinea (Principe).\r\n\r\nIt is made up of two main islands, São Tomé to the southwest and Principe to the northeast, lying between the two Equatoguinean islands of Bioko to the north and Annobón to the south. The entire territory covers an area of ​​approximately 1,000 km2. The volcanic relief culminates at more than 2,000 m, the climate is of the equatorial type. Agriculture - and in particular the production of cocoa - retains an important place, but the expected exploitation of hydrocarbons and the potential for tourism have given rise to great hopes in a poor country, which remains largely dependent on international aid. Sao Tome and Principe is a former colony of Portugal, independent since 1975, and its official language is Portuguese.', 'The economy of Sao Tome and Principe is that of a small island country in Central Africa, a former Portuguese colony, which the main indicators place among the least developed on the planet and half of whose population lives below the of poverty. The archipelago of Sao Tome and Principe traditionally derives most of its resources from agriculture, and in particular from cocoa production - which has earned it the nickname of \"Chocolate Island\", but founds new hopes on the exploitation of hydrocarbons and tourism.<br><br>Santomean economy has suffered from economic imbalances for many years, characterized by a structurally deficit trade balance (- 132 MUSD in 2021). The crisis caused by the COVID pandemic has aggravated the difficulties encountered by the archipelago: situation of over-indebtedness since 2018 amplified in 2020 and 2021, rise in inflation to 8.2%, decline of 0.2% in GDP per capita , etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sao Tome & Principe continues to benefit from the support of international donors and the IMF program currently underway is showing satisfactory results.', 'São Tomé and Príncipe is a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP). The archipelago belongs to several other regional organizations, including the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Gulf of Guinea Commission. Ties remain strong with Portugal and Sao Tome and Principe has also forged close relations with Brazil and Angola.\r\n\r\nWhile Sao Tome and Principe recognized Taiwan since 1997, the Santomean government announced on December 20, 2016 the severance of diplomatic relations with Taipei and the establishment, on December 26, 2016, of diplomatic relations with the People\'s Republic of China. <br><br>\r\n\r\nA former Portuguese colony, Sao Tome and Principe has been independent since July 12, 1975. President Manuel Pinto da Costa then established a single-party Marxist regime, the Liberation Movement of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP).\r\n\r\nUnder the new Constitution of September 1990, the archipelago became a democratic parliamentary republic which opened up to a multiparty system. The first presidential election was won by Miguel Trovoada in 1991. Despite two coup attempts in 2003 and 2009, parliamentary democracy asserted itself and repeatedly allowed an alternation between the two great forces that animate political life: Independent Democratic Action (ADI) of Patrice Trovoada (son of Miguel Trovoada, he was Prime Minister from 2010 to 2012 and from 2014 to 2018) and the Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe (MLSTP) of Jorge Bom Jesus .', 'The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe were colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century and for hundreds of years were an important trading post during the slave trade until its abolition in the 1800s. Contract labor then took the fore, which brought indentured laborers from several African countries to work on the many plantations in the country. Some of these plantations are still active today and can be visited.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis status quo remained in place for many decades until the post-WWII period changed the international political climate forever. In 1950, the country saw the formation of the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP). The movement worked for many years to gain independence but was unsuccessful.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe turning point in the country came in 1974 with the overthrow of Portuguese dictator President Salazar by the people of Portugal. The new government was firm on the idea that all nations should be sovereign and granted independence to São Tomé and Príncipe in 1975, appointing the General Secretary of the MLSTP as president.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe year 1990 was an historic year, not only for the country, but for the African continent, as São Tomé e Príncipe was one of the first African countries to introduce a new constitution that embraced democratic reforms. These reforms included a multiparty system and general elections.\r\n\r\nToday, democracy in the country is still strong and economic strides are being made to develop more infrastructures and manufacture more goods.', 'uploads/lova44.jpg', 'As is evidenced by the São Tomé’s history, the main cultural influences are Portuguese – as a result of the country’s long colonial ties with the European nation – and West African – due to the many slaves that were brought from this region to work on plantations during the slave trade. Both of these influences can be seen clearly in such cultural markers as music and cuisine.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe country’s music is a wonderful amalgamation of African rhythms and Portuguese styles. The African beats are particularly West African in nature, boasting such styles as ussua and socope, and relying heavily on drumming and percussion. That said, Portuguese ballroom dancing is a tradition that has remained incredibly popular, with many national competitions being held around the country.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSão Toméan cuisine is based in equal parts on African traditions and Portuguese influence. Common ingredients are roots like cassava, plantains, and bananas. Unsurprisingly, seafood is a favorite here and there are many seafood dishes which speak loudly of the country’s Portuguese heritage. One such dish is a spicier variation of the Portuguese paella.', 'uploads/download (77).jpg'),
(99, 'Seychelles', '\r\nSeychelles officially the Republic of Seychelles (French: République des Seychelles; Creole: La Repiblik Sesel), is an island country and archipelagic state consisting of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean. Its capital and largest city, Victoria, is 1,500 kilometers (800 nautical miles) east of mainland Africa. Nearby island countries and territories include the Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and the French overseas departments of Mayotte and Réunion to the south; and Maldives and the Chagos Archipelago (administered by the United Kingdom as the British Indian Ocean Territory) to the east. Seychelles is the smallest country in Africa as well as the least populated sovereign African country, with an estimated population of 100,600 in 2022 .', 'seychelles', 'Seychelles was uninhabited prior to being encountered by Europeans in the 16th century. It faced competing French and British interests until coming under full British control in the late 18th century. Since proclaiming independence from the United Kingdom in 1976, it has developed from a largely agricultural society to a market-based diversified economy, characterized by rapidly rising service, public sector, and tourism activities. From 1976 to 2015, nominal GDP grew nearly 700%, and purchasing power parity nearly 1600%. Since the late 2010s, the government has taken steps to encourage foreign investment.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs of the early 21st century, Seychelles has the highest nominal per capita GDP of any African nation. It has the second-highest Human Development Index of any African country after Mauritius.\r\n\r\nSeychellois culture and society is an eclectic mix of French, British, and African influences, with more recent infusions of Chinese and Indian elements. The country is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, the Southern African Development Community, and the Commonwealth of Nations.', 'The Seychelles have been classified since 2015 in the category of high-income countries (10,764 USD per capita in 2022, the highest in Africa). They are the only representatives of Africa in this category.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the country recorded a GDP growth rate of 5.8% due to the rebound in tourism.\r\n\r\nThe UNDP ranks Seychelles in the category of “high human development” countries in 2021 (HDI at 0.785, i.e. 72nd out of 191 countries, down slightly). Seychelles is steadily rising in Transparency International\'s corruption perception ranking (from 45th place in 2014 to 23rd in 2022).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Seychelles economy also remains poorly diversified and vulnerable to international shocks. Its first pillar is tourism, the sector of which has been experiencing strong growth for several years (with the exception of the years 2020-2021 due to the pandemic). France was in 2022 the second provider of tourists to the Seychelles, behind Germany. The second pillar of the Seychelles economy is fishing, in particular industrial tuna fishing. Victoria is indeed one of the busiest tuna ports in the world.', '\r\nIndependent since 1976, the Seychelles archipelago suffered a coup in 1977, leading to the establishment of a Marxist-inspired one-party regime led by France Albert René. James Michel, his successor as President of the Republic from 2004 to 2016, manages to consolidate the transition of Seychelles towards a pluralist democracy and a liberal economy.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSeychellois political life is bipolarized between the United Seychelles Party (formerly SPPF at independence - Seychelles People\'s Progressive Front - then Lepep, the people in Creole, from 2009 to 2018), in power from independence until the last elections in October 2020, and the SNP (Seychelles National Party), led by the current president, Wavel Ramkalawan, which was the main opposition party.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSeychelles is a member of several regional and international organizations: the African Union (AU), the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa - the Common Market for Eastern Africa and South Africa), SADC (Southern African Development Community), IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association), Vanilla Islands Association, Organization internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), the Commonwealth, and the International Criminal Court (ICC).<br><br>\r\n\r\nSeychelles voted in favor of all resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nFollowing the eruption of maritime piracy of Somali origin in the Indian Ocean and in the Seychelles exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in 2009, the Seychelles invested in the regional maritime security architecture. They thus support the European Atalanta counter-piracy mission. Victoria is also home to the headquarters of the IOC\'s Regional Center for Operational Cooperation (RCCO), established in 2017 as part of the European Union-funded Maritime Security (MASE) project.', 'Because they are located too far from busy shipping routes, it is almost certain that the Seychelles were not visited by the first Persian and Arab sailors who sailed in the Indian Ocean around the coasts of Asia, Persian Gulf, North Africa and the Red Sea. On the other hand, there is no doubt that they were, much later, the first visitors to the Seychelles, long before its “discovery”. The merchant Al Mas\'eudi, who regularly visited the Maldives in the fourteenth century, spoke in his writings of the \"high islands\" that were on his route. The discovery of graves in 1910 confirmed the presence of Arab sailors on the island. In 14th and 15th century documents, the Seychelles appear as Zarin, the sisters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese are the first Europeans to venture into the Indian Ocean. In 1498, Vasco da Gama rounds the Cape of Good Hope and is the first European to reach India – with the assistance of an Arab navigator. In March 1503, during a second trip to India, Vasco da Gama reached the islands that today belong to the Seychelles, Silhouette Island and then Desroches Island, according to Thomé Lopes (en) reports by writing of the voyage of the 4th Portuguese Armada to the Indies (Gama, 1502), according to the compilation Delle Navigationi et Viaggi (1550-1559) by Giovanni Battista Ramusio. From 1506, the Seychelles began to appear under different names on Portuguese maps. It is therefore likely that the Portuguese passed several times near these islands and possibly stopped there. There is no evidence to suggest that they founded colonies, the islands serving them above all as a source of food supply, for example with giant tortoises. With the help of Arab navigators, the Portuguese explore the region: Madagascar, the Comoros archipelago, Reunion and Mauritius.', 'uploads/lova46.jpg', 'European and British, African, Indian and even Moorish cultures are intertwined in the traditions of Seychelles people. All these cultures are reflected in the speech of the Creoles and in the art: music, dances, theatre.  <br><br>\r\nIf you want to witness the melting of cultures of different ethnic groups into one place all at the same time, the Creole Festival is something you definitely would not want to miss. Held in October every year, this week-long celebration is an escape from the dull, monotonous life. You can dive into the sea of cultures and explore exotic cuisines, drinks, music and dance and that too with a multi-racial tinge. The festival is organized on the islands of Praslin, La Digue and Mahe. The Creole Festival is a symbolic tribute to the colourful culture, customs, traditions and practices of the Creole lifestyle.', 'uploads/download (78).jpg');
